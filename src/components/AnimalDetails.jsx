            About the Lion
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native
            to Africa and India. It is the second-largest living cat after the
            tiger. Lions are known for their majestic appearance and are often
            referred to as the "King of the Jungle."
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-4">Habitat</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Lions primarily live in savannas and grasslands, where they have
            access to prey and open spaces for hunting. They are found in
            sub-Saharan Africa and a small population exists in the Gir Forest of
            India.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-4">Diet</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Lions are carnivores and primarily hunt large mammals such as zebras,
            wildebeests, and buffaloes. They are also known to scavenge when the
            opportunity arises.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <li>
              Lions live in groups called prides, which consist of related
              females, their offspring, and a small number of adult males.
            </li>
            <li>
              They are social animals and communicate through vocalizations,

              Lions are most active during the night and early morning, spending
              much of the day resting.
